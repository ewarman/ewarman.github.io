Hi! If you're reading this, I'm honored that you visited my site! Thanks for stopping by.

I started this blog to share things I learn as a new grad software engineer. It sounds kind of boring, but I think I can make it fun. Computing is one of the most exciting things that's ever happened to me. Since I wrote my first line of code three years ago as a Mechanical Engineering major at IIT, I have been on a roller coaster of change, learning, and exploration. Writing code has allowed me to have a life that I've always dreamed about -- one where I'm never bored!

I read a lot of computing related blogs and two things bother me. There's a lack of women authors, which is a big reason why I started my blog. I also wish authors of technical blogs shared a little more about themselves. So to honor my second point, here are 10 not computer related fun facts about me:

1. I went to college intending to be an English major.  
2. I've lived in 9 different places so "Where are you from?" is like the worst question to ask me.
3. I love listening to the radio. If I didn't write code, I'd want to work for NPR. My current favorite podcast is Death, Sex, and Money.
4. My favorite job I've ever had was coaching 8th grade girls volleyball. Not sure if Google will top it.
5. My immediate family members are becoming Canadian citizens.
6. I've never owned a car and get around in crazy ways.
7. I love sheet masks. I did a sheetmask in Spiderman: Homecoming and had zero shame.
8. I was in a sorority in college (Kappa Phi Delta, one of America's oldest local sororities).
9. My good luck charm is a little rubber pig my mom gave me. Her name is Louise!
10. I have a hard time paying attention to TV and movies, but I love seeing movies in theaters

My alma mater wrote a [nice article about me](http://science.iit.edu/computer-science/qa-emily-warman) a while ago if you're looking for some additional reading.
