Hi! If you're reading this, I'm honored that you visited my site! Thanks for stopping by.

I started this blog to share things I learn as a new grad software engineer. Since I wrote my first line of code in 2014 as a Mechanical Engineering major at [IIT](http://science.iit.edu/computer-science/qa-emily-warman), I have been on a roller coaster of change, learning, and exploration. Writing code has allowed me to have a life that I've always dreamed about -- one where I'm never bored!

This blog was built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I am using my own custom theme that I haven't published yet! I'll keep y'all posted when it's available for use.
